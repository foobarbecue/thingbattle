Falling things could be tweets streamed from Twitter.

Maybe they enter the atmosphere like meteorites. Then they would be tweeteorites.

Maybe you need to add parachutes or sprinkle them with water to keep them cool. I guess the parachute idea is a bit like
Lemmings.

If tweets get high enough in the sky (above a floating red line), then everybody, or a subset of everybody, re-tweets it.
